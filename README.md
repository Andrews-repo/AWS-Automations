# AWS-Project
Hello there!

You're probably wondeing why I've linked you here, and I will gladly answer that for you:

I needed a place to showcase skills I actually have from working with Amazon Web Services. 

I spent a long time studying and working to acheive the 3 Associate Certificates from Amazon; using both acloudguru.com as well as linuxacademy.com. 

These websites offered a lot of labs and projecs to do to get my hands dirty, and by all means feel comfortable with AWS. 

That being said I wanted to find a project to ~~struggle~~ work through, to push myself to learn, as well as solidify my AWS skills. 

Well, I found one, and used it as a guide to make [This](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/blob/master/gitignore.md).

It's actually the steps from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/), but instead, linking to my code or the files containing the code, which is all listed in this github [here](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project).

The goal here is to simplify the process for any potential empolyers to view what ive done in a somewhat organized manner. 

This project is a work in progress (as of March 25 2020), has gone under many revisions, and will be expanded upon to include more services over time.
