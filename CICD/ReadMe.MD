Continuous Delivery

* As you become more familiar with Automating deployments you should explore and implement a Continuous Delivery pipeline.
* Develop a CI/CD pipeline to automatically update a dev deployment of your infrastructure when new code is published, and then build a workflow to update the production version if approved. Travis CI is a decent SaaS tool, Jenkins has a huge following too, if you want to stick with AWS-specific technologies you'll be looking at CodePipeline.
