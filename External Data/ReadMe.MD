External Data

* [Create a DynamoDB table and experiment with loading and retrieving data manually, then do the same via a script on your local machine.](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/blob/master/External%20Data/cli-maketable-adddata.sh)


* [Refactor your static page into your Fortune-of-the-Day website (Node, PHP, Python, whatever) which reads/updates a list of fortunes in the AWS DynamoDB table. (Hint: EC2 Instance Role)](https://github.com/Andrews-repo/AWS-Project/blob/master/External%20Data/AutoNodeSite_AS_LB_DB.yml)

This script used to work, needs to be fixed. 

* Checkpoint: Your HA/AutoScaled website can now load/save data to a database between users and sessions

The script linked above "DID" do this, but after a break from working it no longer works.
