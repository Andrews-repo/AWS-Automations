Web Hosting Basics

* Deploy a EC2 VM and host a simple static "Fortune-of-the-Day Coming Soon" web page.
* Take a snapshot of your VM, delete the VM, and deploy a new one from the snapshot. Basically disk backup + disk restore.
* Checkpoint: You can view a simple HTML page served from your EC2 instance.
